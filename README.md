# time.php installation script

(tested on Ubuntu 18.04)

1) Download the time.sh on the server.
2) Grant execution to the script: "chmod +x time.sh"
3) Execute the script "sudo bash time.sh"
	(It will update the base repository, install apache and php on the server and
	 create the time.php file on /var/www/html/)

4) On a web browser type "http://ServerIP/time.php"
